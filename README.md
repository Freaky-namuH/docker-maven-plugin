Docker Maven Plugin
===
Project Goal:

* Make it easy to build an app on a container, test it and push it to a Docker repository, even if it relies on other containers (e.g. a database)
* Talk "Maven" rather than "Docker" (E.g. "package" rather than "build").
* Keep it simple.

* Do you want to know how to get started? Read the [usage](USAGE.md).
* Having problems? Read about [debugging](DEBUG.md).
* What to get involved or add features? Read about [contributing](CONTRIB.md).
* What to know what's changed recently? Read the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).
* Read about us in the [press](PRESS.md).
