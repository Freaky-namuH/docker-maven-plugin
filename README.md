Docker Maven Plugin
===

This project aims to make it it easy to build an app on a container, test it and push it to a Docker repository, even if it relies on other containers (e.g. a database). 
We tend to talk "Maven" rather than "Docker" (E.g. "package" rather than "build"). And we like to keep it simple.
